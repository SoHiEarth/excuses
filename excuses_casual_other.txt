Ah, didn't catch you there.
I was just lost in thought about something important.
Sorry if I seemed distracted.
I was just taking a moment to myself.
Oh, I was just daydreaming for a bit.
I didn't mean to ignore you.
I was just reflecting on something.
Sorry, I was just zoning out for a moment.
I was just caught up in my own world for a second.
I didn't mean to seem distant.
