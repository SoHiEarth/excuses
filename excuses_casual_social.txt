Hey, my phone was acting up, so I couldn't respond earlier.
Sorry for the late reply, I got caught up with some unexpected errands.
Just saw your message now, my bad for the delay!
I'm reinstalling my operating system, it's taking longer than I thought.
The Wi-Fi was down at my place, so I couldn't get back to you sooner.
I just lost power, everything's back now though!
I was in a meeting that ran longer than expected, sorry for the wait!
Hey, I was helping a friend with something urgent, just got back to my messages.
I was out for a walk and didn't have my phone with me, sorry about that!
