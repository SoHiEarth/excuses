Hello, my apologies for the delayed response. My phone was experiencing technical difficulties.
I apologize for the late reply; I was occupied with some unforeseen errands.
I have just seen your message; please forgive the delay in my response.
I am currently reinstalling my operating system, which is taking longer than anticipated.
The Wi-Fi at my residence was down, preventing me from responding sooner.
I experienced a power outage, but everything is restored now.
I was engaged in a meeting that extended beyond the expected time; I apologize for the wait.
I was assisting a friend with an urgent matter and have just returned to my messages.
I was out for a walk and did not have my phone with me; I apologize for any inconvenience caused.
The internet connection was unstable, which delayed my ability to reply promptly.
